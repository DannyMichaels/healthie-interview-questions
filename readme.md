## From Daniel Michael

Thank you guys for the test, the todo app was pretty fun, and I am glad I got to do some ruby again.

I am looking forward to the next steps, and I hope to hear from you soon.

I, Daniel Michael, can confirm that this submission is my own work, and that I haven't used AI tools to help me solve the tasks.
